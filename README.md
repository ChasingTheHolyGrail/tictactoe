The `screenshot_tool.py` script can be used to generate screenshots of the game (requires Python and Playwright). This is particularly useful for iterative UI improvements via Coding Agent, as it allows you to quickly capture and share the current state of the interface.

**Iterative Development Workflow:**
1. Capture screenshot → 2. Analyse screenshot → 3. Generate feedback → 4. Implement feedback → and so on...
